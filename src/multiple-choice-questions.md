# Multiple choice questions

Multiple choice questions are not the most effective way to study. The reason
they are commonly used in an academic setting is because they are easy to mark,
and they allow the person studying to demonstrate their ability to recognize the
correct answer, even if they canâ€™t produce it themselves.

When you need to pick from a selection of answers, it is easy to "cheat", as you
can guess what the correct answer is if you know what the other displayed options
are. When multiple choice tests are designed by humans, the test creator can create
clever "distractors" that are similar to the correct answer, making it harder for
you to guess. Computers are not so good at this.

If you are studying for a test and you have a sample test with a
multiple choice questions, like the following:

    Q: What animal has a really long neck?

    A: 1. A monkey. 2. A giraffe. 3. A donkey. 4. A snail.

Then the recommended way to put that question into Anki is to drop the incorrect
answers, turning it into a simple question/answer card instead:

    Q: What animal has a really long neck?

    A: A giraffe.
