# Getting Help

## Asking good questions

With the exception of AnkiMobile, Anki and its support is provided free of
charge, by people who generously volunteer their time. They are not obligated to
help you, and if you post rude or unclear questions, it discourages people from
answering you.

To increase the chances of getting an answer, please try to resolve the issue on
your own first:

- Read the [getting started](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/getting-started) section
  of the manual, and check out the intro videos.
- Use the search button on this page to search frequently asked questions.
- Use the search button in the manual.
- Google the issue.
- If you've encountered a bug, please follow [these
  steps](https://faqs.ankiweb.net/when-problems-occur.html).

If you have tried the above and are still stuck, it's time to ask for help.
When writing a post, please explain the problem you are having clearly, and in detail.

Please avoid vague questions like:

> "My Anki doesn't work, what should I do?"

Instead, please provide as much detail as you can. For example:

> "When I double-click on the Anki icon, an error message pops up. I tried
> searching for the error on Google, but couldn't find anything useful. I have
> copied and pasted the error message to the bottom of my post. I followed the
> steps on the 'When problems occur' page, but the error message does not go
> away. What should I do?"

This is a much better question. It tells us:

- What you have tried.
- What steps you are taking when the problem happens.
- What problems/errors you are getting when things go wrong.

Knowing these things makes it much easier to answer your question.

## Anki Desktop (the computer version)

After reading the above section, please post on the
[user forums](https://forums.ankiweb.net) for assistance.

## AnkiMobile (iPhone/iPad)

Please start by taking a look at [AnkiMobile's
manual](https://docs.ankimobile.net/#/) to see if your question is covered
there. If you still have questions or need to report a bug, please post either
on the [user forums](https://forums.ankiweb.net) which Damien checks regularly, or
create a [private ticket](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/private).

## AnkiDroid (Android devices)

Please see [AnkiDroid's support page](https://docs.ankidroid.org/help.html).

## Private questions

Where possible, please use the [user forums](https://forums.ankiweb.net) - you
do not need to provide your full name, and your email address will only be
visible to support staff/forum moderators. Questions posted on the user forums
are likely to be answered faster, as they can be seen by more people.

If you need to write something that shouldn't be seen by the public, please
create a [private ticket](https://anki.tenderapp.com/discussions/private) on the
old support site.
